# Overview

This super simple plugin uses NLP to parse your content for dates and times so that they can be easily tracked through your yournal pages.

## Toolbar

*Navigate*

Click on `Today`, or the left/right chevrons to navigate to today's journal page or the next or previous days'.

*Weekly View*

1. Ensure the correct start day of week is selected in the plugin settings. 
2. Click on `Week <number>` to navigate to the weekly view.
3. This will create:
   - A page in the format `YYYY/Week XX`
   - Page embeds for all the dates in that week

## Auto Inline Parsing

As per the video, use `%enable auto-parsing%` to turn on auto parsing (off by default) and `%disable auto-parsing%` to turn it off.

Or, you can just use the hotkey combination `a p` to toggle auto-parsing on and off.

## Semi-auto Inline Parsing

Like auto inline-parsing, but this time the parsing is triggered only if the date/time language is prefixed with an `@`, `%` or `^`. Without the prefix, the block will not auto-parse. The available prefixes are:

-   `@` is to simply parse the date
-   `%` converts it to a scheduled item
-   `^` converts it to a deadline item

You can use the hotkey combination `s p` to toggle semi-auto-parsing on and off. See the video below for instructions:

## Using the Command Palette

Use `Ctrl + Shift + p` for Windows or `Cmd + Shift + p` for Mac. Then type `@goto` and select the first option that comes up. You will be presented with a search box to enter the day or date you want to go to.
